# Attendance Tracker App

## Introduction

Traditionally, attendance tracking in educational institutions has been done through manual methods such as roll call or sign-in sheets. These methods involve the instructor calling out the names of students or having students sign their names on a sheet of paper to indicate their presence.

The Attendance Tracker App is a comprehensive solution that streamlines attendance tracking for educational institutions. The application utilizes QR codes to manage attendance, offering an efficient and convenient method for both students and instructors. The app is divided into two primary components: a mobile app for students and instructors, and a website primarily for administrative and instructor purposes.
